## 😎About Me

I am Giovan Battista (but you can call me GB). I am originally from Italy but I'm currently located in New York City. I recently received my PhD in Math from the City University of New York (if you are curious about the content of my thesis, you can get your own digital copy [here](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/4775/)). Halfway through my graduate program I picked up an interest in Data Science. Over the following years, through constant practice, many readings and original projects, this interest turned into a professional passion. Now that I've graduated, I'm excited to officially start my career as a Data Analyst and see where this journey takes me.
